# SmartBottle_Project

## Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a Smart Water Bottle that encourages individuals to maintain optimal hydration. 
By addressing psychological barriers to sufficient water intake, this smart bottle not only tracks the user's water 
consumption but also reminds them to drink water regularly. The bottle uses sensors to measure water intake and provides 
reminders, ultimately promoting a healthier lifestyle through improved hydration habits.

## Problem Statement:
The intervention is designed to motivate users to overcome psychological barriers related to hydration, 
making it easier to prioritize water intake throughout the day. Many individuals neglect hydration due to
forgetfulness, busy schedules, or lack of awareness of its importance. This smart water bottle helps users 
overcome these obstacles by offering features that remind and track water consumption.

## Features:
- Real-Time Water Tracking: The smart bottle uses a Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the amount of water consumed.

- Reminder Alerts: Timely alerts remind users to drink water if they haven't consumed enough within a certain time frame.

- Hydration Analytics: Tracks and displays daily water consumption, average intake, and last water intake time.

- Health Insights: Provides users with insights and reminders for balanced hydration based on their activity level.

## Existing Solutions & Improvement:
A previous case study of a smart water bottle incorporated sensors to measure water hardness and temperature. 
Our proposed Smart Interactive Water Bottle improves upon this by focusing on hydration tracking and reminders 
to encourage timely water intake.

## Target Customer Segments:
- Fitness Enthusiasts: Track hydration during workouts, running, and other fitness activities.

- Health-conscious Individuals: For those mindful of hydration as part of a balanced lifestyle.

- Office Professionals: Helps busy professionals stay hydrated throughout the workday.

- Students: Reminders aid students in managing hydration during classes and study sessions.

- Medical Needs: Supports individuals with medical conditions requiring careful water intake monitoring.

## Components:
- DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.

- Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor: Tracks water intake by measuring water level.

- ModeMCU-ESP8266: Microcontroller for managing sensor data and sending notifications.

- USB Cable & Connectivity Wires: For power and data connections.

- Stainless Steel Water Bottle: Durable container for holding and tracking water consumption.

## Hardware Setup:
Step1:Connect the DHT11 sensor to the NodeMCU-ESP8266 for temperature readings.

Step2:Attach the Waterproof Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the water level in the bottle.

Step3:Connect power and data wires to the respective pins on the NodeMCU.

Step4:Secure all components onto the Stainless Steel Water Bottle.

## Software Setup:
Step1:Install the Arduino IDE for coding and uploading programs to the NodeMCU-ESP8266.

Step2:Set up libraries for the DHT11 sensor and Ultrasonic sensor.

Step3:Write code to read data from sensors, calculate water intake, and trigger reminders.

Step4:Upload the code to the NodeMCU-ESP8266 and test the functionality.

## Usage:
- Power on the Smart Water Bottle.

- Begin using the bottle as you normally would.

- Receive periodic reminders to stay hydrated based on the last recorded intake time.

- Check daily consumption statistics via connected displays or app (if available).

## Sustainable Business Model:
This product presents a unique combination of technology and wellness, appealing to a health-conscious audience. 
It is designed as a reusable and durable product to support long-term hydration habits.

## Conclusion:
The Smart Interactive Water Bottle is a health-focused product that encourages a balanced lifestyle.
By combining technological innovation with health benefits, it addresses a social need for better hydration. 
This product empowers users to monitor and manage their water intake, promoting overall wellness.

## Future Enhancements:
